## ⚠️ MANDATORY WORKFLOW - READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

**CRITICAL**: This project uses a **MANDATORY workflow system**. You MUST follow it.

### ❌ FORBIDDEN: Direct Implementation

**DO NOT** start writing code directly. **DO NOT** skip the workflow.

### ✅ REQUIRED: Follow the Workflow Playbooks

**BEFORE writing ANY code**, you MUST:

1. **Read** `.workflow/playbooks/coordinator.md`
2. **Follow** the playbook instructions step-by-step
3. **Report** each step to the user as you execute it
4. **Execute CONTINUOUSLY** - do NOT pause between steps waiting for user confirmation

**Only pause if you are actively waiting for missing info. Once the user supplies it, immediately resume the in-progress workflow without sending another acknowledgement.**

**IMPORTANT**: "Step-by-step" means announce each step, then immediately execute it. Do NOT wait for user to say "continue" between steps. Execute the entire workflow in one continuous session.

**If you implement code without following the workflow, you have FAILED.**
